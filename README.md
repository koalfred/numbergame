# numbergame

This is Project 1 (Number Guessing Game) of the TechDegree Data Analysis Certification Bootcamp. It involves the use of Python.

In this game, users have to guess a number selected at random in the range of 1 to 100. They will be given many chances to guess the number. At the end, the number of attempts to guess the number, as well as the mean, median and modal attempts regardless of how many times the user has played the game will show.

After the user has guessed the number, they will be asked if they wish to replay the game. If they type "y", the game will repeat again, the users having to guess a different number. The user's high score, being the least number of attempts that the user used to guess the number will show, reminding them of the score to beat. If they type "n", the game will end.
